# ========================================
# INTERACTIONCREATE.EZ - Interaction Handler
# ========================================
# This file demonstrates how interactions would be organized
# In the actual bot, this is integrated into main.ez
# Written in PURE EzLang syntax

# NOTE: In EzLang, events are defined using the "listen" syntax directly
# This file shows what would be in a separate module if imports were supported

# Example interactionCreate event handler (see main.ez for actual implementation):
#
# listen interactionCreate with interaction {
#     var interaction_type = interaction.type
#
#     if interaction_type == "APPLICATION_COMMAND" {
#         var command_name = interaction.commandName
#         # Handle slash commands
#     }
#     else if interaction_type == "BUTTON" {
#         var custom_id = interaction.customId
#         # Handle button clicks
#     }
#     else if interaction_type == "SELECT_MENU" {
#         var custom_id = interaction.customId
#         # Handle select menus
#     }
#     else if interaction_type == "MODAL_SUBMIT" {
#         var custom_id = interaction.customId
#         # Handle modal submissions
#     }
# }
